> Empowered by advanced AI model APIs (Open AI / Azure), this application facilitates seamless translations of technical documentation based on context.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/09c4753f-2155-4757-8e8a-d49bb5911f72/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/translator-app-ts-front/deploys)

The translator app is an essential tool for businesses that require accurate translations of technical documentation. While popular text translation tools like Google Translate and commercial deep-learning-based solutions are effective for common communication topics, they often fall short when it comes to less commonly used languages or highly specialized terminology.

For instance, the bi-lingual international company the application was initially designed for requires all technical documents to be provided in both Russian and Vietnamese languages. Unfortunately, existing translation tools frequently produce unreadable gibberish due to the narrow-field terminology involved. This results in a significant amount of manual labor being required on what should otherwise be an automatable task.

To address this issue, we have developed an AI-powered application designed specifically for enhancing the accuracy of translations by utilizing private databases with pre-existing samples from various fields and industries. By doing so, we can significantly improve efficiency while also reducing costs associated with manual corrections - ultimately providing better quality service overall!
